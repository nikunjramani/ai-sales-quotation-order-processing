# Sales Quotation & Order Processing

A multi-business platform, still being built, that turns customer enquiries into checked quotations and, after customer acceptance, into confirmed sales orders.

The goal is a reusable product that many businesses (tenants) can use with their own email or messaging channels and their existing ERP or inventory system. It is also a learning project for LangChain, LangGraph and reliable workflow engineering, so every part is documented in plain language.

> **Status (2026-10-23):** M0-M4 are complete (local and CI): drafted quotation versions, a shared approval service, a React portal with a development login, and a simulated manager channel. M5 (approved quotation PDFs and delivery to API clients) is implemented and verified locally; CI is pending. Real email/Telegram and orders are **not built yet**; see the [roadmap](.docs/plan/roadmap.md).

## What it will do
1. Receive an enquiry from email, Telegram, an API and later WhatsApp or Instagram.
2. Use AI to read the request and match products. AI never sets prices, stock, tax or approvals.
3. Read live prices and stock from the business's own ERP, which stays the source of truth.
4. Calculate the quotation with exact, rule-based arithmetic.
5. Send it to a manager for approval in the portal, by email reply or in a messaging app.
6. Deliver the approved PDF, track the customer's response and create the order in the ERP after acceptance.

## What works today
| Area | Status |
|---|---|
| Project setup, settings, health API (`/health/live`, `/health/ready`) | ✅ M0 |
| PostgreSQL with separate owner and runtime roles; row-level security per tenant | ✅ M0 |
| Tenant membership, roles (administrator, sales operator, approver, viewer) and permission checks | ✅ M1 |
| Deterministic quotation calculator: Decimal money, per-tenant rounding and tax, quantity and unit rules; a missing price is never treated as zero | ✅ M1 |
| ERP contract plus a simulated ERP with two fictional businesses | ✅ M1 |
| Enquiry intake API with API keys, replay-safe idempotency keys and durable receipt | ✅ M2 |
| Background worker with leased, retried, crash-safe jobs; attachment quarantine and inspection | ✅ M2 |
| Requirement extraction (LangGraph, checkpoints): free rules interpreter or local Ollama model, swappable; verbatim checks, ERP matching, clarification questions | ✅ M3 |
| Quotation versions, manager approval (portal + simulated channel), revision loop, React portal with dev login | ✅ M4 |
| Approved quotation PDFs (stored, hash-checked), delivery outbox with honest outcomes, customer download API, portal preview and delivery status | ✅ M5 (local; CI pending) |
| Email/Telegram (incl. manager approval by email reply), orders, OIDC login | ⏳ Planned (M6-M7) |

## Tech stack
Python 3.13, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), FastAPI, SQLAlchemy 2, Alembic, PostgreSQL 17 (Docker Compose), pytest, Ruff, mypy (strict) and GitHub Actions. LangChain and LangGraph power requirement extraction (M3) and the approval workflow (M4). The portal is React + TypeScript (Vite, Vitest; Node 22.12+).

## Quick start
**Prerequisites:** Python 3.13, uv 0.13+, Git, and Docker Desktop with Linux containers running. On Windows, Docker needs the WSL / Virtual Machine Platform features enabled.

```powershell
# 1. Install the locked dependencies
uv sync --locked

# 2. Create local-only database passwords in an ignored .env file (prints no secrets)
uv run python scripts/init_local_env.py

# 3. Start PostgreSQL and wait until it is healthy
docker compose up -d --wait

# 4. Apply migrations, check the schema and run all tests against the database
uv run python scripts/check_database.py

# 5. Load fictional demo businesses, users and pricing policies
uv run python -m quotation_app.persistence.seed

# 6. See a priced quotation, a blocked request and access checks
uv run python scripts/demo_quotation.py

# 7. Create an API key for intake (token printed once) and run the background worker
uv run python scripts/create_api_key.py --tenant 11111111-1111-4111-8111-111111111111 --role intake_service --name "local test"
uv run python -m quotation_app.worker

# 8. Score the enquiry interpreter on the synthetic dataset (free rules interpreter by default)
uv run python scripts/evaluate_extraction.py
```
Submitting an enquiry with the key is shown in the [setup guide](.docs/development/setup.md#enquiry-intake-m2). An existing M0/M1 database needs a one-time [upgrade step](.docs/development/setup.md#upgrading-an-existing-local-database-m0m1-to-m2).

Run the API:
```powershell
uv run uvicorn quotation_app.api.app:create_app --factory --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```
Then open http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs. For the portal and approvals, see [approvals and portal](.docs/development/setup.md#approvals-and-portal-m4).

Stop the database with `docker compose down`. Your data is kept; adding `-v` deletes it.
The full walkthrough and troubleshooting are in the [setup guide](.docs/development/setup.md).

## Running checks
```powershell
uv run ruff check .                 # lint
uv run ruff format --check .        # formatting
uv run mypy                         # strict type checking
uv run pytest                       # unit tests (integration tests are skipped)
uv run pytest tests/unit            # unit tests only
uv run python scripts/check_database.py   # migrate both DBs + all tests on quotation_test
```
Integration tests never touch your development data: they need `--run-integration` plus explicit `TEST_*` URLs that must name a `*_test` database, which `check_database.py` supplies. CI runs everything on every push. See [testing](.docs/development/testing.md).

Domain code imports no framework, database or provider code; [a test](tests/unit/test_architecture.py) enforces this.

## Core rules
- **Tenant isolation:** one business can never see another's data. Membership is checked in the database and PostgreSQL row-level security adds a second guard.
- **ERP is authoritative:** prices and stock come from the business's system, stamped with source and time. Nothing is invented.
- **Deterministic money:** exact `Decimal` arithmetic with named rounding rules, never floats.
- **Human approval:** every quotation, and every future negotiated revision, needs manager approval. AI never negotiates on its own.
- **Untrusted input:** customer text and documents are treated as data, never as instructions.
- **Safe retries:** external actions will use durable jobs, an outbox and idempotency so retries never create duplicate orders.
