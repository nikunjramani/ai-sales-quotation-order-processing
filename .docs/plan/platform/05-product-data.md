# 5. Product data: how catalogue, prices and stock reach us
**The problem:** quotations are only as good as the product, price and stock data behind them. Today it comes from a hardcoded demo ERP, and a new business would have none. Businesses keep this data in very different places:
- an ERP or accounting system (Tally, Zoho Inventory/Books, Odoo, ERPNext, SAP Business One...);
- an online shop (Shopify, WooCommerce);
- a spreadsheet;
- nowhere written down.

## Design: one read contract, many sources
The existing **`ErpReader` port** (renamed in the docs to **catalogue source**; the code name can stay) already holds everything the core needs:
- `search_products`
- `list_categories`
- `get_products`
- `get_prices` (with effective dates and price list)
- `get_availability` (stock, or "unknown")

The core keeps calling only this. Each business **chooses its source** in the portal, as a [connection](03-connectors.md) with purpose `catalogue`. The worker resolves the source **per business** from that connection, instead of the hardcoded `SimulatedErp`.

| Source | How it works | Freshness | Effort | Fits |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A. Spreadsheet import** | Manager uploads CSV/Excel (or links a Google Sheet). A mapping screen matches columns (SKU, name, category, unit, price, currency, stock, min qty). Rows are checked, errors are shown per row, and a good file replaces the active version. Stored in **our catalogue tables** | As of the upload; stock gets an "as of" time and the existing stale rules apply | Medium | Small businesses, pilot, demos |
| **B. Manual entry** | Add and edit products, prices and stock in the portal. Same tables as A | As entered | Low (with A) | Very small catalogues, corrections |
| **C. ERP / shop connector (live)** | An adapter reads the business's system on demand, using the existing contract and contract tests | Live | Per system: medium to high; needs that system's API and sandbox | Businesses with an ERP/shop |
| **D. ERP / shop sync** | An adapter copies the system into our catalogue tables on a schedule or by webhook; the core reads our tables | Minutes behind | Per system | Systems with slow or limited APIs; also prepares for E |
| **E. Our own inventory (future)** | Our catalogue tables grow into a full stock system (movements, reservations, warehouses) | Live, it is the source | Large; a future product | Businesses with no system that want one |

**Decided (D18, user 2026-10-23): manual entry in the portal (B) only for now**; spreadsheet import, ERP and shop connectors come in later phases. We store these products (D19). Original recommendation, for context:
- Build **A + B** first: our own catalogue tables plus a "local catalogue" source.
  - It works for every business on day one, needs no outside accounts, and is the foundation for E.
  - Real ERP connectors (C/D) follow for the pilot business's actual system.
  - The existing simulated ERP stays for tests and demos.

## Our catalogue tables (for A, B, D and later E)
All under tenant row-level security:
- `catalogue_products`: internal ID, SKU (unique per business), name, description, category, unit, minimum quantity, quantity step, attributes (JSON), active.
- `price_lists` and `price_list_items`: currency, unit price, effective from/to, version. History is kept, because quotations already record the price list ID and version.
- `stock_levels`: product, warehouse, available quantity (or unknown), as of, source.
- `catalogue_imports`: file, column mapping, row errors, status, who, when. The active version is switched atomically.

The "local catalogue" source implements the same contract and passes the same contract tests as the simulated ERP.

## Decision this needs: ADR 0003
ADR 0003 says the platform is "not a replacement inventory database" and keeps only evidence and disposable caches. Options A, B, D and E mean storing a business's catalogue as **their chosen source of truth**. Proposed amendment (D19):
- **When a business connects an ERP, the ERP stays authoritative.**
- **When a business chooses spreadsheet or manual entry, our catalogue is their source,** and the business is responsible for keeping it up to date. The portal shows "as of" dates, and stale stock is flagged as today.

## Product matching on real catalogues
- **Today:** the demo search is simple word matching. With hundreds or thousands of real products, matching quality matters.
- **First:** PostgreSQL full-text search plus trigram similarity (`pg_trgm`) on SKU, name and category. Free, built in.
- **Later, optional:** semantic search with embeddings (pgvector), already listed in the roadmap (M10). Only as a candidate finder; the final match still comes from the source's own products, and the AI never invents a SKU.
- **Synonyms per business** ("ss bolt" = "stainless steel bolt"), editable in the portal (D20).

## Not in scope yet
Customer-specific prices, discounts, several tax rates, cost and margin. They are open in `open-decisions.md` and can be added to the price list model later without breaking it.
