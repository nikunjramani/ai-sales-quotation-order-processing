# 0003: Existing ERP remains authoritative
Date: 2026-10-22
Status: accepted design; implementation pending

## Context
Businesses already manage stock and pricing elsewhere.

## Decision
Read current business facts through ERP adapters. Store immutable quote evidence and optional disposable caches, not a replacement stock ledger. Use a simulated ERP for development and a real sandbox before release.

## Alternatives considered
Require catalogue/stock migration; let AI estimate facts; treat cached stock as a reservation.

## Consequences
Vendor mappings and capabilities vary; unsupported or unavailable writes require explicit exception paths.

## Verification
Same ERP contract suite for simulated and real implementations; stale data and unknown-price tests.
