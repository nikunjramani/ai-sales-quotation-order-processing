"""Rate limits counted in PostgreSQL, shared by every API process (user answer Q5).

Fixed windows: the first attempt for a key opens a window of the rule's length; attempts are
counted until it ends, then the count starts again. One upsert does the counting atomically, so
two processes can never both see "the 10th attempt". The key (an IP address, an email...) is
stored only as a SHA-256 hash. A few expired rows are deleted on each call, so the table stays
small without a separate clean-up job.
