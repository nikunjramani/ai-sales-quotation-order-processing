"""Quotation approval workflow (LangGraph with human-in-the-loop interrupts).

    START -> draft --priced--> request_approval -> await_decision -> apply_decision
               \\                     ^                                  |  approve -> approved
                \\--pricing failed--> await_revision <-- request_revision -+  reject  -> rejected

    approved -> await_customer -> apply_customer -> end  (accepted, declined, expired, withdrawn)
                                        | prices changed -> request_approval (revised version)
                                        |                   or await_revision (cannot be priced)

- draft:            price the extracted lines with the M1 calculator; store version 1, or the
                    pricing issues if the ERP facts cannot price them.
- request_approval: create the approval task for the current version (and its notification job).
- await_decision:   pause (interrupt) until a manager decides. The process can stop meanwhile;
                    the pause lives in the PostgreSQL checkpoint.
- apply_decision:   read the recorded decision (the approval service already stored it).
- await_revision:   pause until a sales operator stores a new version.
- approved:         queue delivery of the approved version to the customer (M5).
- await_customer:   pause until the customer answers, staff withdraw, or validity ends (M6).
- apply_customer:   closing answers end the run. "Prices changed" continues with the revised
                    version (request_approval), or with await_revision if it cannot be priced.

Resume jobs carry what they answer (a decision, a new version or a customer answer). A job that
does not match what the run is waiting for is stale and ignored, so a duplicate never applies
twice.
