"""Reading a manager's written reply to an approval request (D10, phase 5). Pure rules.

The AI (when a model is configured) suggests what a reply means; these deterministic rules
decide what is done with that suggestion. They are the safety rules of D10 in code:
- the reply is cleaned first (only the new text, at most MAX_REPLY_CHARACTERS);
- guard(): an approval is never taken from conditional, mixed, negated or questioning words,
  nor when the reply names another quotation; a reason must be copied from the reply;
- an AI-read decision is never recorded at once: the manager confirms it with an exact YES
  (or cancels with NO), user answer P5-13. confirm_word() reads only those two words.
Without a model, written replies are not read at all (user answer P5-5).
