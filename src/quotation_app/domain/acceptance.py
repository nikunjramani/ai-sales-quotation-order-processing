"""Customer answers to an issued quotation (M6; decisions in ADR 0016).

An issued quotation is an approved version whose PDF reached the customer. Until its validity
ends, the customer may accept or decline exactly that version (named by version number and
content hash). Accepting re-prices the lines from the ERP first: any price difference refuses the
acceptance and the system drafts a revised version for manager approval. Staff may withdraw an
unanswered quotation. After "valid until" it expires and stays closed.

M6 records acceptance only; it creates no ERP order and reserves no stock.
