"""Quotation documents (PDFs) and their delivery to the customer.

A quotation document is the customer-facing PDF of one approved version. It is rendered once,
stored privately, and recorded with its own SHA-256 so anyone can check that the file sent is
the file stored. Only approved versions get a document; drafts can only be previewed, and every
preview page says it is not an offer.

A delivery is one attempt to make that document reach the customer through the channel the
enquiry came in on. Its status says what we actually know, never more:
- pending:   queued, not yet attempted (or a transient failure that will be retried);
- sending:   handed to the channel; if the worker crashes here we cannot know if it arrived;
- available: pull channels (the API): the customer can now download it;
- sent:      push channels (email, messaging): the provider accepted it;
- failed:    it cannot be delivered (no channel adapter, rejected, rendering impossible);
- unknown:   the provider may or may not have it (timeout after sending). Never resent
             automatically, because the customer could get it twice; a person must check.
