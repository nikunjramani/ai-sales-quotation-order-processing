"""Orders: what an accepted quotation becomes (phase 7, roadmap M6b, ADR 0024).

An order copies the accepted quotation version's lines and totals exactly (the version stays
the signed evidence). One order per quotation, ever (the purchase guard, Q4). Its status says
what the business knows, never more:

  placed -> confirmed -> in_progress -> shipped -> delivered      plus cancelled and on_hold

Where an order is kept (fulfilment):
- local: the business has no ERP that takes orders; staff move the status in the portal;
- erp:   the order is written to the business's ERP once, by an order operation; from then on
         its status follows the ERP (the ERP is the authority, ADR 0003). Staff do not move it.

Order operations (the ERP write) record intent before the call, like the outbox (ADR 0015):
pending -> sending -> succeeded | failed | unknown -> (reconciled) succeeded | needs_attention.
An unknown outcome is never sent again automatically unless the ERP itself refuses
duplicates (OrderCapabilities.idempotency_key); otherwise the reference is looked up for a
while, then staff decide.

Decisions (user, 2026-10-29; Claude where the user delegated, ADR 0024): created automatically
or by staff per business (default staff); stock is re-checked when the order is created and a
shortfall holds the order for staff; no stock reservation; staff may cancel a local order before
it ships (an ERP order is cancelled in the ERP); customers hear about confirmed, shipped,
delivered and cancelled; "track my order" shows the asking contact's own orders only.
