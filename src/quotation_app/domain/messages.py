"""Outgoing messages: the outbox row, its statuses and the fixed wording (ADR 0018).

Everything we send (a quotation to a customer, an approval request or a notice to a manager)
is first stored as an outbound message, then handed to the connection's provider by the
send_message job. Statuses say what we actually know, never more (same rules as ADR 0015):
- pending:   stored, not yet attempted (or a transient failure that will be retried);
- sending:   being handed to the provider; a crash here means we cannot know if it arrived;
- available: pull providers (the API): the recipient can now fetch it;
- sent:      push providers: the provider accepted it;
- delivered: the provider later confirmed it reached the recipient;
- failed:    it cannot be sent (connection gone, refused, task already decided...);
- unknown:   the provider may or may not have it. Never resent automatically.

Wording is fixed in code (templates), never written by AI. A template turns parameters into the
message text plus metadata a provider may show (quotation number, task ID...). Single-use
approval tokens are never part of a stored message: they are created at send time.
