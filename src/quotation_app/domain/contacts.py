"""Customers (contacts), their addresses on each tool (identities) and consent (phase 4).

- A contact is one customer of one business. Website chat visitors give a name and an email or
  phone (D12); these are stored as *claimed* (Q2) and never used to merge or to send.
- An identity is one address of a contact on one connection: a chat visitor ID, an API
  customer_reference, later a phone number on WhatsApp. Messages are tied to identities.
- Consent (D15): a whole message STOP / UNSUBSCRIBE / OPT OUT opts the identity out, START opts
  it back in. An opted-out identity is sent nothing except the opt-out confirmation.
- Viewers see email and phone masked (Q12); other staff roles see them in full.
