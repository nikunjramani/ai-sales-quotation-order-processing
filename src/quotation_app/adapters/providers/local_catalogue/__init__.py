"""Provider `local_catalogue`: the business's own product list, kept with us (phase 3, ADR 0020).

A product source only (purpose catalogue): staff type products, prices and stock into the
portal, and LocalCatalogue serves them to the quotation core through the ERP port. It has no
messages, webhooks or secrets. Another product source later (a spreadsheet sync, an ERP, a
shop) is another provider package with purpose catalogue that passes the same ERP contract
suite; the business switches its catalogue connection, with no core change.
