"""Business logo checks and re-encoding with Pillow (phase 2, Q16).

An uploaded image is untrusted: image parsers have had many security bugs, and huge images can
exhaust memory ("decompression bombs"). So:
- only PNG and JPEG, recognised by their first bytes (not by the name or declared type);
- at most 1 MB and 4 megapixels, checked from the header before any pixels are decoded;
- the image is decoded once, shrunk to at most 600 x 240 px and saved as a fresh PNG. Nothing
  from the original file (metadata, extra chunks, scripts) survives; only pixels do.
