"""Generic provider callbacks (ADR 0018; platform routes and handshakes in phase 5).

POST /api/v1/hooks/{connection_id}/{webhook_token}
  The URL names the connection and carries its secret token; the provider's own signature is
  checked on the raw body before parsing. Events are stored once and routed by a job, so the
  answer is quick:
  200 {"received": n, "duplicates": d}   stored (or already stored)
  404 "Not found"        unknown connection, wrong token, not active or no webhook support
  413 "Event too large"  401 "Invalid signature"  400 "Invalid event"
  503 "Try again later"  the database is unavailable; providers retry and dedupe makes it safe
POST /api/v1/hooks/p/{provider_key}
  One URL for the whole platform (one bot, one app): the provider checks the request with our
  company-level secrets, then the request's own routing keys name the business. A genuine
  request is always answered 200, also when no business claims it or its content is refused,
  so the tool neither retries it nor switches the webhook off. 401 only for a bad signature.
GET on either URL
  A verification handshake (e.g. echo a challenge), answered by the provider; 404 otherwise.
