"""The Provider contract: what every tool package (api, simulated, Telegram...) offers.

A provider package registers a factory under the Python entry point group
`quotation_app.providers`; the registry builds every installed provider at start-up. Adding a
tool is one package plus one entry point. No core code changes (ADR 0018,
.docs/development/adding-providers.md).

Rules for implementations:
- Never take the tenant from a request. The tenant is always the connection's.
- verify_inbound (or verify_platform_inbound) runs on the raw bytes before parse_inbound; a
  forged or stale request raises InboundRejected.
- send raises SendRejected when the provider refused for good and SendUncertain when the
  message may have been accepted (it is then never resent). Any other exception means nothing
  was handed over, so the attempt may be retried.
- Operations a provider does not support raise OperationUnsupported, never a fake success.

Phase 5 adds the one-click lifecycle (provision, resume, deprovision), platform webhooks for
tools with one callback URL for the whole platform (verify_platform_inbound, routing_keys),
GET handshakes, files fetched after a webhook, account-linking hints and provider-hosted setup
pages. ProviderDefaults gives every optional operation an explicit "not supported", so a
package only writes what its tool can do.
