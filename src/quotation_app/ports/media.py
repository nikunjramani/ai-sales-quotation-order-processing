"""Short-lived public links to one approved quotation PDF (phase 5, contracts C6).

Some tools download attachments from a URL instead of receiving the bytes. The link carries a
random token (only its SHA-256 is stored), names one document, and stops working after
QUOTATION_MEDIA_LINK_MINUTES. The API finds it by the token's hash alone, like an API key.
