"""Secret store contract: provider credentials live here, never in the database (D8).

The database keeps only opaque references such as "local:<uuid>". Each secret belongs to one
tenant; asking for it with another tenant's ID fails as if it did not exist. Implementations
are chosen by the entry point group `quotation_app.secret_stores` (local for development,
none until a cloud store is chosen, D24).

Company-level secrets (our own bot token, app secret, master account...) live in a separate
platform namespace per provider key (phase 5, contracts C5). They are written once by an
operator command, never through the business portal, and are named rather than referenced.
