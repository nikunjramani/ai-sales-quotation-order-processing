"""Manager approval channel contracts: bindings and action references (sending is the
outbox's job, ADR 0018).

A channel binding links an internal manager (subject) to one external account on one provider
connection. It is created only through enrollment (proof of control) and can be revoked.
Action references are opaque, expiring, single-use tokens bound to one task and one binding.
