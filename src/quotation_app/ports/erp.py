"""ERP read and write contracts. Every ERP adapter, simulated or real, must pass the shared
contract suites (tests/unit/ports/test_erp_contract.py, test_erp_writer_contract.py).

Rules for implementations:
- Scope every call to context.tenant_id; never return another tenant's records.
- Omit unknown SKUs from results. Never return placeholder zero prices or stock.
- Stamp results with source and a timezone-aware fetched_at.
- Raise ErpError with a normalized code on failure; never fabricate a successful result.
- Writes (ErpWriter, phase 7): raise UNKNOWN_OUTCOME when the request may have reached the ERP
  (a timeout after sending); never claim success or failure you do not know. A second create
  with the same reference must never make a second order: answer CONFLICT or the same order.
