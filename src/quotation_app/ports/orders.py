"""Storing orders, their timeline and their ERP write (phase 7, ADR 0024).

Rules for implementations:
- One order per quotation: create raises OrderExists (with the existing order) when the
  quotation already has one, also when two creates race.
- create, change_status and finish_operation each run in one transaction that also writes the
  order event and queues the follow-up job (the ERP write, a reconciliation, a customer notice,
  the status refresh), so nothing is half done after a crash.
- change_status is compare-and-set on the expected status: None when the order moved meanwhile.
- begin_send is compare-and-set pending -> sending; only its winner may call the ERP.
- Order lines and events are never changed; every call is scoped to one business.
