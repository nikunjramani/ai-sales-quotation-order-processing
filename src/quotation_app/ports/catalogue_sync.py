"""Storing a product source's catalogue copy and the record of each sync run (phase 6).

Rules for implementations:
- apply stores a whole feed in one transaction: products created, updated, restored or
  archived (no longer offered), prices and stock counts added only when they changed, a change
  log row per product change, and the run marked succeeded. Either all of it or nothing.
- Prices are copied only in the business currency; other currencies are an issue, never a
  conversion.
- finish and apply queue the next scheduled run in the same transaction when next_run_at is
  given, so a crash can never end the schedule.
- Every call is scoped to one business.
