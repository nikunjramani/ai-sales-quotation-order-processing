"""Storage of our own product catalogue (phase 3, ADR 0020).

Two ports over the same tables:
- CatalogueReadStore: the few reads LocalCatalogue needs to act as the business's ERP. The
  adapter layer may not run SQL itself, so it reads through this port.
- CatalogueStore: everything the product screens need (ProductService).

Rules for implementations:
- Every call is scoped to one business; another business's rows are never returned or changed.
- Prices and stock counts are only ever added, never changed or deleted.
- Products and categories carry a row_version; a write with an older version raises
  VersionConflict instead of overwriting someone else's change.
- Every product and category change is recorded in the change log in the same transaction.
- A store that cannot be reached raises CatalogueUnavailable (never an empty result).
