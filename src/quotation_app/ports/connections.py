"""Connection storage contracts (ADR 0018).

ConnectionStore reads one tenant's connections. HookLookup is the one cross-tenant read: the
generic webhook route knows only a connection ID from its URL, so it may reveal exactly that
row (and its webhook token hash) and nothing else, like the API key lookup. Phase 5 adds the
self-service lifecycle store and platform routes (RouteLookup reveals one route by its key).
