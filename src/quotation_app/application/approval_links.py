"""The signed approval link (phase 5, P5-14): one click after sign-in, as the right manager.

Every approval request sent to a linked account also carries a portal link with the same
single-use token as its buttons (only its SHA-256 is stored). Opening it needs sign-in
(the portal session; P5-14), and only the manager the request was sent to may use it; anyone
else gets "this link is not for you". The page shows the exact version; a deliberate click
(POST with CSRF, never the GET) decides through the same ApprovalService as everything else,
and consumes the reference. Unknown tokens are "not found"; decided, changed or expired
requests show their state instead of buttons.
