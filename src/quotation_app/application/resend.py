"""Resend a customer message that could not be sent (phase 5, user answer 2026-10-29).

Administrators and sales operators may send a failed message again (for example when a tool
only delivers within 24 hours of the customer's last message, and the customer has written
again). The failed message stays as it was; a copy becomes a new message with its own send
job, conversation row and quotation delivery link. Each failed message is resent at most once
(a failed copy can be resent in turn). A message whose outcome is unknown is never resent:
it may have arrived.
