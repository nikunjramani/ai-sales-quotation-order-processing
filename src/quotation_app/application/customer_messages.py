"""Messages to customers on the tool they wrote from (phase 4).

CustomerMessenger.send is the one place that decides whether a customer message is queued:
- the enquiry must have a conversation (API enquiries without customer_reference have none,
  Q5): otherwise there is nobody to write to, and nothing is queued;
- pull tools (the API) are skipped: the customer's own system reads the enquiry status and the
  quotation through the API, as before. Only push tools (website chat, later WhatsApp...) get
  messages;
- the message goes to the conversation's identity on the conversation's connection, through
  the outbox, with a fixed template and an idempotency key, so a retried job never repeats it.
Whether the customer may receive it (consent, D15) is checked at send time by
CustomerConsentHook: an opted-out identity's message becomes failed with the reason, never
silently dropped. Nothing is pushed before Go live (SendMessageHandler, phase 2).
