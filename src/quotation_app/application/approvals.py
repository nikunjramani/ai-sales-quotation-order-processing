"""The single approval decision service used by the portal and every manager channel.

Inputs: an authenticated subject (from a session or a verified channel binding) and a
DecisionCommand. Output: the recorded decision, or the earlier one for an exact replay.
Every call re-checks current membership and permission, task status, version freshness and
self-approval inside a transaction holding the task lock. Errors: AccessDenied,
PermissionDenied, SelfApprovalNotAllowed, TaskNotFound, StaleVersion, DecisionConflict.
