"""Routing a customer's message within their conversation (phase 4).

Every tool's customer message goes through the same store method (IntakeStore.record), which
locks the customer's conversation and asks an EnquiryRouter which open enquiry, if any, the
message continues. IntentRouter is that router: an ordered list of handlers, the first one that
claims the message wins. FollowUpHandler applies the agreed follow-up rules; anything it does
not claim starts a new enquiry.

Later intents ("where is my order?", payments, "talk to a person") are more handlers added to
the list in the composition root. The router never names a provider, and AI intent detection,
when it comes, is one more handler (not in v1).
