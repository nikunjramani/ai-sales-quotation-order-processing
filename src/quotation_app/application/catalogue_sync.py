"""Copying a business's ERP or shop catalogue into ours on a schedule (phase 6, ADR 0023).

Purpose: quotations search our own copy (fast, our search, works while the ERP is slow) while
final prices and stock are checked live. Inputs: a sync_catalogue job naming the connection
and why it runs (connected, schedule, manual). Output: a sync run record and the stored copy.

Rules:
- only the business's active product source is copied, and only if its provider declares
  CatalogueCapabilities.sync; otherwise the job does nothing and the schedule ends (the
  source was replaced or disabled);
- every failure is recorded on the run (the last good copy stays) and the schedule goes on:
  the job itself succeeds, so a broken ERP never kills the repeating run;
- "Sync now" adds one manual run that does not repeat; at most one waits at a time.
The interval is the connection's generic `sync_minutes` config value (set by its provider).
