"""Manager channel actions: enrollment (binding an account) and approval decisions.

Transport adapters verify the provider's signature first and pass a normalised ChannelEvent.
This service then checks that the account is enrolled, the action reference belongs to that
exact account and task, and hands the same DecisionCommand used by the portal to the
ApprovalService. A forwarded message used by another account fails; so does a revoked binding.
