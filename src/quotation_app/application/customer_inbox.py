"""Customer messages that arrive on a provider's webhook (phase 5; phase 4's WI-6).

They take the same road as website chat and API messages (IntakeStore.record with the
follow-up router), so a reply continues the customer's open enquiry. Rules (user answers,
2026-10-29, same as website chat):
- 10 messages a minute and 100 a day per sender; over a limit the message is still stored but
  held for staff review, never read by the AI (the business-wide daily reading cap of the
  extraction step applies as well);
- files: PDF, text, PNG, JPEG up to 5 MB, at most 5 per message and 20 a day per sender,
  downloaded from the tool into quarantine; other kinds (voice, video, stickers) are skipped
  and noted for staff;
- STOP / START as the whole message are consent changes (D15);
- a message the business itself typed on its own account is a staff message: kept in the
  conversation, never read as the customer's words or as a command;
- nothing is taken from a suspended business.
