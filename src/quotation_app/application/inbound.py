"""Provider callbacks on the generic hook route: verify, store once, route later (ADR 0018).

POST /api/v1/hooks/{connection_id}/{webhook_token} reaches InboundService.receive:
1. Find the connection by ID and compare the token's SHA-256 in constant time. Unknown,
   wrong token, not active, provider not installed or without webhooks: all the same
   HookNotFound, so a caller learns nothing about which check failed.
2. Refuse bodies larger than the provider allows.
3. The provider verifies the raw bytes (signature, timestamp) BEFORE anything is parsed.
4. The provider parses the body into normalised events. The tenant is always the
   connection's, never something named in the body.
5. Each event is stored once (dedupe on connection, provider event ID and type) together with
   a process_inbound job, in one transaction. The webhook answers at once; the job routes it.

Routing is by event type, never by provider: a manager action goes to the same
ChannelActionService (and ApprovalService) the portal's decisions use.

Phase 5:
- POST|GET /api/v1/hooks/p/{provider_key} reaches receive_platform: tools with one callback
  URL for the whole platform (one bot, one app). The provider checks the request with its
  company-level secrets first, then names the routing keys present in it; each key that names
  a connection (connection_routes, exact match) is parsed in that connection's business. A
  verified request that no connection claims is answered by the provider generically
  (Provider.unrouted) and nothing is stored. Genuine requests are always acknowledged, even
  when their content is refused, so the tool does not retry or switch the webhook off.
- GET on either route is a verification handshake (Provider.handshake).
- Customer messages go to the CustomerInbox at once (the same road as website chat).
- A connection still being set up (or in error) accepts only setup events (ConnectionUpdate).
